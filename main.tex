\Large \bf ABSTRACT
\end{center}
\vspace{0.2in}

I am going to design and present a model for an Electronic Voting System for India. In this document , I'll talk about many vital and essential issues that have to be taken into account while designing a Digital Voting system for India. 
\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
The Model will satisfy many properties which make it a good model. Then I will argue thet why is it a very good model to be implemented.


% \vspace{0.5cm}

In this design project, I shall work as observers, developers and algorithm enthusiasts to understand the ways and finding different means to approach and tackle the objectives in a more well defined mathematical way. 

\vspace{0.2cm}
% I shall work with full confidence and zeal to achieve the goal or reach to quite an end of the problem so that using our lemmas, proofs and knowledge, someday a perfect model can be implemented using a software by some other Computer Explorer. As a matter of interest, I just wish to argue that these things can be computed by our brain so I do hope to find a solution to this problem using machine learning algorithms. Since, Machine Learning algorithms are more or less based on Mathematical matrices, with the use of computer graphics, I expect to find a start with matrices that I have dealt with further in this report.

\chapter{Introduction}

The problem of Electronic Voting is one that is not limited to India, but a global problem. Using the cutting edge technology I hope to present a solution to this problem which will save us plants, workforce and sheer administrative manpower by a once effective and efficient investment by the governing body.

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Defining the problem}
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Why do we need a Voting system ?}
\section{How do we Currently Vote ?}

\chapter{Desirable Properties}
\section{Introduction}
What should be some properties of an EVM ? And how should we decide them ?
Certifiablity of hardware , software and firmware checks. Verifiability
\section{Properties}
Now let's formally list the ideally desirable properties of Electronic Voting System.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Coersion - Freedom : What is it ? More of a Social vs Comp sc problem, will be the first to go when we go for feasible systems .
  \item Secrecy : My vote shouldn't be visible to the public. Just who I voted to, but it should be counted (verifiably). 
  ? As anonymouty is already a point, this point might be refering to design of the EVM itself, it should be open source and could be easily checked by anyone.
  \item Non-Repudiation : 
  \item Veriafiable : 
  \item Cryptographic : (No one central authority should have access to the data?) (Blockchain kind of?)
  \item Audit : 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Proving there is no bias/unfairness . [Weightage of votes?] [1 person 1 vote]
    \item Proof of Correctness of entire voting process .
  \end{itemize}
  \item Anonymity : My vote shouldn't be visible to anyone else, and should be correctly visible to me .
  \item Self Certifiablity : The EVM's hardware, software and firmware should be self-certifiable. [A prof of being tamper free and being correct]
  \item Infomation Leakage : The model should have no sensitive information leakage . But at the same time, if someone comes, that prove to me my vote was casted to this particular party, the system should be able to give a proof of truthfullness / falsifyability of his statement.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Technical and Political Aspects}
Can a model like this really be implemented ? Who has the power to do this ? Who will conduct this ?
Social aspects ? Proof at every step ?
\section{Key Aspects}

\chapter{Useful Systems}
\section{RSA Cryptosystem}
What is it ? Why is it secure ? Proof of it's security ? Why breaking it is infeasible ? Why does it work ? Basic level ? What are the current use cases ?
Ex Wifi : Key is already in the air, but you can't reach it :) . WPA2 security 
\section{Blockchain}
What is it ? Why is it secure ? Proof of it's security ? Why breaking it is infeasible ? Why does it work ? Basic level ? What are the current use cases ?
Ex : Bitcoin : How will it change the conventinal currency system, no central governing body and other advantages.


\chapter{Model}
\section{Software Part}
\section{Hardware Part}
\section{Correctness}
How many desirable properties does it satisfy ? How is it feasible for Implementation in the whole country ?
\section{Scalability}
\section{Implementational feasibility}


\chapter{Epilogue}
\section{What does it accomplish ?}
What changes does it bring in the Elections that weren't there previously ?
\section{Applications}
Where else can this system be applied ?
\section{Future Scope}


\chapter{Conclusion}
What are some key learnings throught this excersize ? That even thought algorithm is fully open source, no one can break it .
